# Introduction

The **template-validation-service** is a [Maven Archetype](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-archetypes.html) 
acting as a supporting resource for the GITB test bed software and specifications. It can be used as template from which
to build a fully working GITB-compliant validation service to be used through the GITB test bed but also standalone
for content validation.

The GITB specifications are the result of the
[CEN Global eBusiness Interoperability Test bed (GITB) Workshop Agreement](http://www.cen.eu/work/areas/ict/ebusiness/pages/ws-gitb.aspx).
Evolutive maintenance of the GITB specifications and software is now performed by the European Commission's DIGIT under 
the [Interoperable Europe](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/interoperable-europe) initiative. For more information please
check the [Interoperability Test Bed's site](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/solution/interoperability-test-bed/about) on Joinup. 

# Build instructions

This Archetype is developed in Java and is built using Maven 3+, To build issue the following:

```
mvn clean install
```  

To perform a release and deploy to the Central Repository the profile `release` needs to be specified:

```
mvn clean deploy -P release
``` 

This profile triggers in addition the following:
* Generation of the source JAR.
* Generation of the Javadocs.
* PGP signature of all artefacts. To do this you need a GPG local installation. In addition if multiple keys are
  defined you can specify the appropriate one using the `gpg.keyname` system property. Furthermore, the passphrase 
  entry mode is set to use system property `gpg.passphrase`. These properties can be provided either on the command 
  line or in Maven's `settings.xml` by means of a profile.
* Deploy to the Central repository's staging environment and automatically promote the release.

Using the Archetype to generate a new project is through [Maven's Archetype Plugin](https://maven.apache.org/archetype/maven-archetype-plugin/index.html).
To use it issue (replacing `VERSION` with the version you want to use):

```
mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=eu.europa.ec.itb -DarchetypeArtifactId=template-validation-service -DarchetypeVersion=VERSION
```
